## Overview  
**IsoShift** is an interactive isometric room environment. Explore the room, move objects, and manipulate the space in a clean 2.5D perspective. Navigate your avatar by clicking on the screen, drag cubes around, and stack them to reach new heights. This project combines simplicity with engaging interactivity.
