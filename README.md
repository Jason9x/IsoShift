## Overview
**IsoShift** is a player-interactive isometric room environment. Walk around the room, grab objects, and warp the room space in a clean 2.5D representation. Steer your avatar by clicking on screen, move cubes around by dragging, and pile them up to new heights. This project has simplicity combined with engaging interactivity.
